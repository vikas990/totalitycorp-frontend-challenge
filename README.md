## Description
    Tried to create Tesla Hompage UI With ReactJs.

## Approach:-
    1. Navbar created using flexbox.
        - Created a file called array item which contains the list of menu items. because the item were different in mobile and desktop.
        - Created a Custom Hook to keep track of the window size to switch the array for the drawer element.
        - Created Custom Hook there might be a case in future that we will require to keep track of height and width of the window. so we can directly use the hook.
    
    2. Main Section.
        - use array item file to keep all the values and pull dynamically so that in future addition or deleteion will be there.
        - footer will only be visible in last section.
