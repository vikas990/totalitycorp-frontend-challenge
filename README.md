## Description
    Tried to create Tesla Hompage UI.
    
  ## Tech Stack
        1. React
        2. JavaScript
        3. HTML
        4. CSS

## Approach:-

    1. Navbar created using flexbox.
        - Created a file called array item which contains the list of menu items
           because the item were different in mobile and desktop.
           
        - Created a Custom Hook to keep track of the window size 
            to switch the array for the drawer element.
            
        - Created Custom Hook there might be a case in future that we will require to keep track of height and 
        width of the window. so we can directly use the hook.
   
    2. Main Section.
    
        - use array item file to keep all the values and pull dynamically so that 
        in future addition or deleteion will be there.
        
        - footer will only be visible in last section.
